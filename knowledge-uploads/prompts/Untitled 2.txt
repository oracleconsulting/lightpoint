# HMRC Letter Analysis and Complaint Drafting Guide

When receiving an HMRC letter, follow this framework to identify issues that may warrant a complaint and craft an effective response:

## Step 1: Identify Potential Complaint Triggers

### Timeline Analysis
- Check dates of HMRC actions against reasonable timeframes
- Calculate total duration of investigations/inquiries (anything beyond 12-18 months for standard matters is concerning)
- Note gaps between HMRC communications (gaps exceeding 3 months often warrant mention)
- Compare actual response times to HMRC's own standards (typically 15-30 working days)

### Content Assessment
- Look for contradictions between this letter and previous HMRC communications
- Check for mathematical or factual errors in calculations or assessments
- Identify if HMRC is requesting information previously provided
- Note if HMRC is taking action despite an ongoing dispute or appeal

### Charter Commitment Violations
- **Getting Things Right**: Incorrect information, errors in calculations, wrong conclusions
- **Being Responsive**: Delays beyond reasonable timeframes, failure to respond to previous communications
- **Making Things Easy**: Complicated or unclear instructions, multiple requests for the same information
- **Treating You Fairly**: Unreasonable demands, failure to accept valid evidence, presumption of fault
- **Being Aware of Your Personal Situation**: Ignoring hardship, vulnerability, or special circumstances
- **Keeping Your Data Secure**: Sending information to wrong addresses, data breaches

## Step 2: Document Collection

Gather supporting evidence:
- Previous correspondence with HMRC (with exact dates)
- Proof of submissions or payments (with reference numbers)
- Timeline of all interactions on this matter
- Records of professional costs incurred (if applicable)
- Screenshots of online accounts or records that contradict HMRC's position

## Step 3: Draft Your Complaint

### Header Structure
```
[Your Full Name]
[Your Address]

[Your Phone Number]
[Your Email]

[Today's Date]

Complaints Department
HM Revenue & Customs
[Appropriate HMRC Address]

Your Ref: [Any HMRC references]
UTR/NINO: [Your tax identification numbers]

Dear Sir/Madam,

FORMAL COMPLAINT: [Brief description of issue]
```

### Opening Paragraph
State clearly that this is a formal complaint and briefly summarize the issue, referencing the specific HMRC letter you're responding to.

### Chronological Timeline
Present a clear timeline of events with precise dates, showing the progression of the issue and any delays or errors.

### Charter and Guidance Citations
Reference specific HMRC Charter commitments and internal guidance (CRG sections) that have been violated. Common useful citations:
- CRG4025: On unreasonable delays
- CRG5225: On professional fee reimbursement
- CRG6050-6075: On worry and distress payments
- CRG3250: On system failures
- CRG5100: On considering claims for financial redress

### Impact Statement
Describe how HMRC's actions/inactions have affected you, including:
- Time spent dealing with the issue
- Financial implications
- Stress and worry caused
- Any wider impacts (business operations, personal circumstances)

### Clear Remedy Request
Explicitly state what you're seeking:
1. Specific actions to resolve the underlying issue
2. Compensation for worry and distress (typically £25-£500)
3. Reimbursement of professional fees (if applicable)
4. Formal apology and assurance of process improvement

### Closing Statement
```
I expect a substantive response within 15 working days in accordance with HMRC's complaints procedure. If I do not receive a satisfactory response within this timeframe, I will escalate this matter to a Tier 2 review and, if necessary, to the Adjudicator's Office.

Yours faithfully,

[Your Signature]
[Your Name]

## Step 4: Effective Language Techniques

- Use professional but assertive language throughout
- Present facts rather than emotions, but do note emotional impact
- Cite specific policies, timeframes, and figures rather than generalities
- Use comparative statements (e.g., "If I had failed to respond to HMRC for this duration, penalties would apply")
- Include phrases like "I am recording professional time spent addressing this issue" if professional fees are involved
- Reference the "public purse" when noting how HMRC inefficiencies create unnecessary costs

## Step 5: Check Before Sending

Ensure your complaint:
- Clearly identifies which HMRC department/action you're complaining about
- Contains all relevant reference numbers
- Presents a logical, chronological narrative
- Specifically cites relevant HMRC guidance and Charter commitments
- States exactly what resolution you're seeking
- Sets clear expectations for response timeframes

This framework will help you analyze any HMRC communication for potential issues and draft an effective, well-structured complaint that maximizes your chances of achieving satisfactory resolution.
