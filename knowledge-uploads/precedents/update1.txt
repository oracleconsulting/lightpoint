## Template Paragraph for Clear Timeframe Violations

```
I am writing to lodge a formal complaint regarding the unreasonable delay in [specific HMRC action]. According to your correspondence dated [date], this matter has been ongoing since [start date], representing a period of [X years/months]. This significantly exceeds any reasonable timeframe for [type of action] and directly contradicts HMRC's Charter commitment to "Being responsive" and "resolving things as quickly as we can." According to CRG4025, while not every delay is unreasonable, a delay of this magnitude for a matter that [resulted in no changes/was straightforward/etc.] clearly falls below your own standards and constitutes an unreasonable delay warranting remedy under your Complaints and Remedy Guidance.
